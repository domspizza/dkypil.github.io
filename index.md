# Welcome to the MBARI-BOG Protocols manager!
Here you will be able to find resources used by the MBARI BOG group for our Environmental DNA (eDNA) work.

## [Water Sampling](Water_Sampling_page.md)

The first step of environmental DNA projects is to collect your sample! Proper water collection techniques is important to prevent cross contamination of samples and introduction of conatminants during the filtration process. Click on the link or photo above to find resources on water sampling.

Working with environmental DNA samples can be tricky; in this section, we share previous protocols and those currently in use that have been modified as we discovered more relevant and high throughput methods to processing eDNA. Click on the link or photo above to find resources and protocols used by the MBARI BOG team in the lab.

## [MBARI Dry Lab Pipeline](MBARI_dry_lab.md)
[<img width="527" height="280" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30352066/132757381-93a4d3f1-dfc8-4c0d-99ab-05d8af0a4981.png">](MBARI_dry_lab.md)

Now that the 'fun and easy' part is done, it's time to look at the data! Like other Next Generation Sequencing projects, eDNA Metabarcoding produces a LOT of data taht can be daunting to tackle. Here, we provide the general pipeline that we follow in the MBARI-BOG dry lab. Click on the link or photo above to find out more information on the bioinformatics pipeline that the MBARI BOG team uses.

## [Published Data and Associated Analysis Scripts](Published_projects.md)
Here you can find the data and scripts used in our recent publications.
